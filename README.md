# Tax-Free Savings Account Contribution Calcluator

The project here is a calculator for calculating one's contribution limit as of the 2020 year. This is a personal project. This is also my first project I have created alone on github, please forgive me for any difficulties. This is also my first time coding in java for myself. I compiled this on Linux, so my steps on how to run this is only for Linux.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### How to run:

Now in the terminal type:
3) "javac Main.java Tfsa.Java"
4) "cd .."

Voila! You should be able to try the program now on the terminal.
